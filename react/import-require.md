In React, both `import` and `require` are used to include external modules or files into your JavaScript code, but they have some differences in how they work and are used.

1. **Syntax**:
   - `import` is a keyword introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) for module importing.
   - `require` is a function used in CommonJS, which is the module format used in Node.js.

2. **Usage**:
   - `import` is used to import ES modules, which are the standard module system in JavaScript.
   - `require` is used to import modules in CommonJS format, commonly used in Node.js applications.

3. **Static vs. Dynamic**:
   - `import` is statically analyzed by the JavaScript module loader, meaning it's resolved and executed during the compilation phase before the code is executed. This allows for tree-shaking, where unused exports are eliminated from the final bundle.
   - `require` is executed at runtime, meaning it's resolved and executed during the execution phase of the code. This doesn't allow for tree-shaking and may result in a larger bundle size.

4. **Module Types**:
   - `import` can only be used to import ES modules.
   - `require` can be used to import both ES modules and CommonJS modules.

5. **Usage in React**:
   - In modern React applications, `import` is typically used to import React components, hooks, and other modules.
   - `require` is less commonly used in React applications but may be used when working with Node.js modules or when using libraries that are written in CommonJS format.

Here's an example of importing a React component using both `import` and `require`:

```jsx
// Using import
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

// Using require
const React = require('react');
const MyComponent = require('./MyComponent');
```

In most cases, you'll use `import` for importing modules in modern React applications, as it's the preferred way of importing ES modules and provides benefits such as static analysis and tree-shaking. However, if you're working in a Node.js environment or dealing with CommonJS modules, you may need to use `require`.
