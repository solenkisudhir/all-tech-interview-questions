In React, effects created with the `useEffect` hook represent side effects that occur in your components. These effects can be used to perform tasks such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscribing to external events. The lifecycle of reactive effects in React involves their execution at specific points in the component's lifecycle. Here's an overview of the lifecycle of reactive effects and some code examples:

1. **Mounting Phase**:
   - Effects specified in the `useEffect` hook are executed after the component has been initially rendered to the DOM.

   ```jsx
   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

   const MyComponent = () => {
     useEffect(() => {
       console.log('Component mounted');

       return () => {
         console.log('Component unmounted');
       };
     }, []);

     return <div>My Component</div>;
   };

   export default MyComponent;
   ```

2. **Updating Phase**:
   - Effects are re-executed after every render unless specific dependencies are provided in the dependency array. This allows you to control when the effect should be re-executed.

   ```jsx
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

   const MyComponent = () => {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     useEffect(() => {
       console.log('Count updated:', count);
     }, [count]);

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Count: {count}</p>
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default MyComponent;
   ```

3. **Unmounting Phase**:
   - Effects can return a cleanup function, which will be executed when the component is unmounted or before the effect runs again. This is useful for cleanup tasks such as unsubscribing from subscriptions or removing event listeners.

   ```jsx
   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

   const MyComponent = () => {
     useEffect(() => {
       const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
         console.log('Interval triggered');
       }, 1000);

       return () => {
         clearInterval(intervalId);
         console.log('Interval cleared');
       };
     }, []);

     return <div>My Component</div>;
   };

   export default MyComponent;
   ```

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Effects can specify dependencies in the dependency array, which determines when the effect should be re-executed. If the dependencies change between renders, the effect will be re-executed.

   ```jsx
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

   const MyComponent = () => {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     useEffect(() => {
       console.log('Count updated:', count);
     }, [count]);

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Count: {count}</p>
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default MyComponent;
   ```

The `useEffect` hook in React provides a flexible and declarative way to handle side effects in function components. By understanding its lifecycle and usage, you can effectively manage asynchronous operations, subscriptions, and other side effects in your React application.
