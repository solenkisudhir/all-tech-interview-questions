React Routing refers to the process of managing navigation and rendering different components based on the URL in a React application. It allows you to create a single-page application (SPA) with multiple "pages" or views without the need for full-page refreshes.

To implement routing in a React application, you typically use a routing library like React Router, which provides a declarative way to define the routes and their corresponding components.

Here's a basic example of how to set up routing in a React application using React Router:

1. **Installation**:
   First, install React Router DOM, which is the version of React Router designed for web applications:

   ```
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Creating Routes**:
   Define the routes and their corresponding components in your application. This is usually done in the root component (e.g., `App.js`).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';
import NotFound from './NotFound';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        <Route component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

3. **Creating Route Components**:
   Create the components for each route. These components will be rendered when the corresponding route is matched.

```jsx
// Home.js
import React from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
};

export default Home;

// About.js
import React from 'react';

const About = () => {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
};

export default About;

// Contact.js
import React from 'react';

const Contact = () => {
  return <h2>Contact Page</h2>;
};

export default Contact;

// NotFound.js
import React from 'react';

const NotFound = () => {
  return <h2>404 Page Not Found</h2>;
};

export default NotFound;
```

4. **Navigation**:
   Use the `Link` component from React Router to create links for navigating between different routes.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const Navigation = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Navigation;
```

React Router provides various features like nested routes, route parameters, programmatic navigation, and more, allowing you to build complex navigation structures and SPAs with ease.
