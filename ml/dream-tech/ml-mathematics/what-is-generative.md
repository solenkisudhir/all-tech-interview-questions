[Generative AI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-generative-ai/?ref=header_search)
Nowadays as we all know the power of **Artificial Intelligence** is developing day by day, and after the introduction of Generative AI is taking creativity to the next level Generative AI is a subset of [Deep learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-deep-learning/) that is again a part of [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence-an-introduction/). 

In this article, we will explore, 

> **What is Generative AI? Examples, Definition, Models and limitations.**

**Generative AI** helps to create new artificial content or data that includes Images, Videos, Music, or even 3D models without any effort required by humans. The advancements in [LLM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/large-language-model-llm/) have led to the development of Generative AI. 

**Generative AI** models are trained and learn the datasets and design within the data based on large datasets and Patterns. They can generate new examples that are similar to the training data. These models are capable of generating new content without any human instructions.

In simple words, It generally involves training [AI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence-an-introduction/) models to understand different patterns and structures within existing data and using that to generate new original data.

Working of Generative Model

What are Generative Models?
---------------------------

A generative model is a [type of machine learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-types-learning-supervised-learning/) model that is used to generate new data instances that are similar to those in a given dataset. It learns the underlying patterns and structures of the training data before generating fresh samples as compared to properties. Image synthesis, text generation, and music composition are all tasks that use generative models. 

They are capable of capturing the features and complexity of the training data, allowing them to generate innovative and diverse outputs. [Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variational-autoencoders/), [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/), Autoregressive models, and [Transformers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transformer/) are some examples of popular generative model architectures these models help to create new data that helps users in different aspects. These models have applications in creative activities, data enrichment, and difficult problem-solving in a variety of domains.

### **1\. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

The [Generative Adversarial Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generative-adversarial-network-gan/) is a type of machine learning model that creates new data that is similar to an existing dataset. It was proposed by Lan Googfellow in 2014. [GANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-an-introduction/) generally involve two neural networks.- **The Generator and The Discriminator.** The Generator generates new data samples, while the Discriminator verifies the generated data. This design is influenced by ideas from game theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with the strategic interactions between different entities. 

The two networks are trained together in a process in which the Generator attempts to fool the **Discriminator** into thinking the generated data is real, while the Discriminator attempts to accurately detect whether the data is real or fake. This process is repeated until the Generator becomes so good at providing realistic data that the Discriminator can no longer distinguish the difference.  
**GANs** can be used for image synthesis, style transfer, data augmentation, and other tasks.

### **2\. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**

As compared to [GANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-an-introduction/) it follows a different approach. This transforms the given input data into newly generated data through a process involving both encoding and decoding. The encoder transforms input data into a lower-dimensional latent space representation, while the decoder reconstructs the original data from the latent space. Through training, VAEs learn to generate data that resembles the original inputs while exploring the latent space. Some of the applications of [VAEs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variational-autoencoders/) are Image Generation, anomaly detection, and latent space exploration.

### 3\. Autoregressive models

Autoregressive models are a type of generative model that is used in **Generative AI** to generate sequences of data like text, music, or time series data. These models generate data one element at a time, considering the context of previously generated elements. Based on the element that came before it, autoregressive models forecast the next element in the sequence.

### **4\. Transformers**

[Transformers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transformer-neural-network-in-deep-learning-overview/) have transformed Generative AI by introducing a highly effective architecture for tasks like language translation, Text Generation(like the GPT series), and even image synthesis.   
Here is an overview of the main components of the transformer architecture:

*   **Encoder-Decoder Structure:** The transformer’s architecture is divided into an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder processes that sequence. 
*   **Multi-Head Attention:** Multi-head attention captures diverse dependencies and features by considering different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously.
*   **Positional Encodings:** Unlike RNNs, Transformers do not have built-in word sense. Positional encodings are added to input embeddings to represent the places of words within a sequence.
*   **Transformer Decoder:** The decoder uses additional self-attention that focuses on the previously generated words in the output sequence to ensure coherence.
*   **Position-wise Feedforward Networks in Decoder:** Positional encodings include Feed-Forward layers, which are included in both the encoder and the decoder and help to capture contextual information.

However, there are various hybrids, extensions, and modifications of the above models. There are specialized different unique models designed for niche applications or specific data types. As AI is continually evolving newer approaches might evolve around it.

What is Chat GPT, Google Bard, and DALL-E?
------------------------------------------

*   **Chatgpt:** ChatGPT is an [NLP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/natural-language-processing-nlp-tutorial/) tool that is driven by [AI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence-an-introduction/) technology.

It can perform various tasks such as language translation, creating content, and answering different queries.
*   **DALL-E:** It is a new tool that generally helps to create new images with **text-to-graphic** prompts.
