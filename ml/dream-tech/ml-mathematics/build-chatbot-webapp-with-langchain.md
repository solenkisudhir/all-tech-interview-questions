By 2024, generative AI will have advanced to never-before-seen levels thanks to a variety of models that are pushing the envelope in terms of originality and inventiveness.


These ****Generative AI Models**** demonstrate the breadth and depth of applications for Generative AI, ranging from language production to image synthesis. While some models are quite good at producing text that seems human, others produce realistic and beautiful visuals. ****Every model offers a different set of advantages and a window into the seemingly endless possibilities of AI-driven creation.****

In this article, we’ll be looking into ****9 distinct AI generative****, segmented into ****Text, Image, and Code generative AIs.**** Before getting into the Top generative AI models, let’s first understand in brief what is generative AI.

What is Generative AI?
----------------------

****A family of**** [****artificial intelligence****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence-an-introduction/) ****systems known as “****[****generative AI****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-generative-ai/)****” is able to produce new content, including text, images, audio, and even video, that resembles or imitates the data it has been trained on.**** Large datasets are used to teach these systems patterns and structures, which are then used to generate new examples that adhere to the same patterns.

To produce this information, generative AI frequently makes use of neural network techniques, namely [generative adversarial networks (GANs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generative-adversarial-network-gan/) or [variational autoencoders (VAEs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variational-autoencoders/). For example, GANs are made up of two neural networks: a discriminator and a generator.

### Applications of Generative AI

Generative AI may be used to create realistic visuals, write prose that sounds human, compose music, produce artificial voices, and much more. This quickly developing sector offers a wide range of innovative and useful applications.
