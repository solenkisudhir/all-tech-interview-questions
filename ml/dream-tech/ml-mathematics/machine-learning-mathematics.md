# Machine Learning Mathematics 

if you want to build your career in the field of Machine Learning as a beginner or professional looking for a career change then before directly jumping into machine learning you have to know the few Mathematical Concepts which include Statistics, Probability Distribution, Linear Algebra and Matrix, Regression, Geometry, Dimensionality Reduction, Vector Calculus etc. Those Concepts are used very frequently in machine learning for example:- In ML what do we do? We Make a prediction model (Algorithms/classifiers) which is based on training data and then we use that model for making predictions for new data. To evaluate the quality of our model, we use a confusion matrix, which is based on the concept of conditional probability – a crucial mathematical concept. By understanding these mathematical concepts beforehand, it becomes easier for us to understand the concepts of machine learning.

So, That’s how mathematics is used in machine learning and that makes it a crucial part of Machine Learning.

> ****Machine Learning**** is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Math is the core concept in machine learning which is used to express the idea within the machine learning model.
