# Mathematics | Covariance and Correlation


**Covariance** and **Correlation** are two mathematical concepts which are commonly used in the field of probability and statistics. Both concepts describe the relationship between two variables.

**Covariance –**

1.  It is the relationship between a pair of random variables where change in one variable causes change in another variable.
2.  It can take any value between -infinity to +infinity, where the negative value represents the negative relationship whereas a positive value represents the positive relationship.
3.  It is used for the linear relationship between variables.
4.  It gives the direction of relationship between variables.

**For Sample**

Here,  
x’ and y’ = mean of given sample set  
n = total no of sample  
xi and yi = individual sample of set

**Correlation –**

1.  It show whether and how strongly pairs of variables are related to each other.
2.  Correlation takes values between -1 to +1, wherein values close to +1 represents strong positive correlation and values close to -1 represents strong negative correlation.
3.  In this variable are indirectly related to each other.
4.  It gives the direction and strength of relationship between variables.

**Covariance versus Correlation –**



* Covariance: Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together
  * Correlation: Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates how strongly two variables are related.
* Covariance:      involve the relationship between two variables or data sets  
  * Correlation:   involve the relationship between multiple variables as well 
* Covariance:  Lie between -infinity and +infinity  
  * Correlation:  Lie between -1 and +1     
* Covariance:      Measure of correlation   
  * Correlation:   Scaled version of covariance   
* Covariance:      provide direction of relationship   
  * Correlation:   provide direction and strength of relationship   
* Covariance:      dependent on scale of variable   
  * Correlation:   independent on scale of variable   
* Covariance:    have dimensions 
  * Correlation:   dimensionless
