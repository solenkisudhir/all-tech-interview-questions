# Demystifying Machine Learning
This phrase, "machine learning," is potent. These days, machine learning is the hottest topic! What makes it not so? The bulk of "enticing" new developments in computer science and software development typically have a machine learning component that is obscured. Cortana - Machine Learning from Microsoft. Computer vision and machine learning for object and face recognition. The most cutting-edge UX enhancement programs use machine learning (yep, the Amazon product suggestion we got was the result of a machine learning algorithm crunching numbers).

Not only that, either. Data science and machine learning are widely used today. Why? Since data is ubiquitous!

It's not only that. Machine Learning and Data Science generally are everywhere. Why? Because data is everywhere!

Therefore, it's only natural that someone with an above-average brain and can distinguish between Programming Paradigms by looking at Code is enthralled at the prospect of Machine Learning.

What do we mean by Machine Learning? And how big is Machine Learning? Let's explore Machine Learning, once and for all. Instead of presenting the technical specs, we'll use the "Understand by Example" approach.

What is Machine Learning in Reality?
------------------------------------

A branch of artificial intelligence called machine learning developed from computational learning theory and pattern recognition. According to Arthur Lee Samuel, the study of machine learning gives computers the capacity to learn without explicitly coding anything.

Artificial intelligence, which "learns" by analyzing data without human interaction, belongs to this field of study in computer science.

However, there are certain problems with this idea. Due to this misconception, when the phrase "machine learning" is used, it's frequently associated with "artificial intelligence," "neural networks that can emulate Human brains" (currently not achievable), "self-driving cars," and other concepts. The scope of Machine Learning, however, is extremely broad. In this article, we'll examine some common and uncommon uses of machine learning in modern computing.

Machine Learning: What is it really?
------------------------------------

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that evolved from Pattern Recognition and Computational Learning theory. **Arthur Lee Samuel** defines Machine Learning as a field of study that provides computers with the ability to learn without needing to code explicitly.

This area is Computer Science and Artificial intelligence, which "learns" by studying data without human intervention.

However, this notion is not without flaws. Due to this belief, when the term Machine Learning is thrown around, it is usually thought of as "Artificial Intelligence" as well as "Neural networks that are able to emulate Human brains (currently it isn't possible)" or self-Driving cars and so on. However, Machine Learning is far beyond the scope. We will explore some typical and some not generally thought of aspects in Modern Computing where Machine Learning is at work.

Machine Learning: The Expectated
--------------------------------

Let's begin by pointing out some areas where machine learning is used.

1.  **Speech Recognition (Natural Language Processing in more technical terms):**  
    Cortana and Windows devices can converse with one another. What we say is understood by it in what way? NLP stands for natural language processing. It involves the linguistic study of how people and machines interact. Machine learning algorithms and systems, of which Hidden Markov Models are just one, are at the heart of NLP.
2.  **Computer Vision:**  
    Well, one can probably imagine what powers a car. Additional benefits of machine learning. These applications weren't necessarily brand-new. Even the most skeptical of individuals would be able to comprehend these technological achievements, which were made possible by some "mystical (and incredibly difficult) mind-boggling Computer magic."
3.  **Google's Self Driving Car:**  
    Well, it's possible to imagine what it is that drives car. Further Machine Learning goodness.  
    These were not necessarily new applications. Even the most sceptical of people would have an understanding of these technological feats that were brought to life by certain "mystical (and extremely difficult) mind-boggling Computer magic".

Machine Learning: The Unexpected
--------------------------------

Let's look at various industries where people who typically find machine learning difficult to engage with:

1.  **Amazon's Product Reviews:** We may have questioned why Amazon always makes a suggestion that encourages you to spend less. Behind the scenes, "Recommender Systems" are machine-learning algorithms at work. It evaluates each user's preferences and makes recommendations following them.
2.  **YouTube/Netflix:** They operate precisely as described above!
3.  **Data Mining or Data Mining / Big Data:** This may not come as a surprise to everyone. If the goal is to draw information from data, machine learning is waiting nearby. Data mining and big data, however, are the only methods for learning from and researching data that is larger in scale.
4.  **Real Estate, Stock Markets, Housing Finance:** To analyze the market, all of these disciplines use a variety of machine learning methods, specifically "Regression Techniques" for tasks as elementary as estimating a home's value or observing stock market movements.

We may have noticed by now that machine learning is utilized everywhere. everything, including business development for small businesses and research and development. It is finished. This presents a fantastic career opportunity because the sector is expanding and that growth won't stop any time soon.
