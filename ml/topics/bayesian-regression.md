# Bayesian Regression
By tuning the regularisation parameter to the available data rather than setting it strictly, regularisation parameters can be included in the estimate process using Bayesian regression approaches.

This can be achieved by adding uninformative priors over the model's hyperparameters. Ridge regression and classification regularisation are analogous to calculating the greatest a posteriori estimation under a Gaussian earlier than the coefficients. It is feasible to treat lambda as a random variable that can be calculated from the data rather than setting it explicitly.

Bayesian Ridge Regression
-------------------------

The regression problem is modelled probabilistically using BayesianRidge, as previously mentioned. A spherical Gaussian provides the prior for the coefficient.

The priors over and the conjugate before the Gaussian precision are selected as gamma distributions. The final model, Bayesian Ridge Regression, resembles the traditional Ridge.

The gamma prior distributions have four larger hyperparameters, and those are normally chosen to be uninformative.

**Examples:**

### Automatic Relevance Determination - ARD

Similar to the Bayesian Ridge Regression in many ways, the Automatic Relevance Determination (as implemented in ARDRegression) is a type of linear model that produces sparser coefficients \[1\] \[2\].

A different prior over ARDRegression substitutes a centred elliptic Gaussian distribution for the spherical Gaussian distribution. Consequently, each coefficient can be taken from a precision-centered, zero-centered Gaussian distribution with a positive diagonal matrix. Each coordinate of the Bayesian Ridge Regression possesses a unique standard deviation.

**Examples:**

Linear Bayesian Regressor Comparison

Bayesian Regression uses previous conviction or knowledge to "learn" more about the data and make more accurate predictions. In order to produce more accurate estimations, it also takes into account the level of uncertainty in the data and draws on past technological advancements. Therefore, when the information is intricate or complicated, it is the nice alternative.

The parameters of a linear regression model are anticipated in Bayesian Regression based on facts, such as prior knowledge of the parameters and the application of the Bayes set of rules. Compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, its probabilistic character may produce more effective results, provide some degree of uncertainty in the estimation, and convey more accurate values for the regression parameters.

Model selection and outlier detection are two further related regression analysis activities that can be performed using Bayesian Regression.

Bayesian Regression
-------------------

The Bayes theorem is used to calculate the likelihood of a collection of parameters given observed data. The underlying premise of the data-generating process is the main distinction between Bayesian and conventional linear Regression.

Bayesian Regression might be helpful when the dataset has too few or poorly. In contrast to conventional regression techniques, where the output is only derived from a single attribute value, a Bayesian Regression model's output is derived from a probability distribution.

Some Dependent Concepts for Bayesian Regression
-----------------------------------------------

The following are key ideas in Bayesian Regression:

**Bayes's Principle**

The Bayes Theorem provides a link between an event's prior chance and its subsequent chance once all available information has been considered.

**Estimation of the Maximum Likelihood (MLE)**

It looks for the parameter values that provide the observed data with the best chance of fitting the presumptive model. MLE gives point estimates of the parameters and does not take into account any prior knowledge or assumptions about them.

**Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Estimation**

A Bayesian method known as MAP estimation uses the likelihood function and prior knowledge to estimate the parameters. In MAP estimating, the parameters are given a prior distribution representing prior assumptions or information about their values.

Need for Bayesian Regression
----------------------------

*   The previous opinion of the analysis's parameter assumptions is also used in Bayesian Regression. It makes it practical when there is a need for more data, and prior knowledge is essential. Bayesian Regression offers better-informed and more precise estimations of the regression parameters by fusing prior information with the observed data.
*   Bayesian Regression provides a natural way to scale the uncertainty in estimating regression parameters because it generates the posterior distribution, which represents the uncertainty in the parameter values, as opposed to the single component estimate generated by conventional regression techniques. It is possible to calculate reliable or Bayesian confidence intervals using this distribution since it provides a range of acceptable parameter values.
*   It makes it possible to model relationships between the predictors and the response variable that are more complex and realistic.
*   By computing the posterior probabilities of several models, Bayesian Regression makes it easier to choose and compare models.
*   Unlike traditional regression techniques, Bayesian Regression handles outliers and significant findings more effectively.

Implementation of Bayesian Regression
-------------------------------------

Let us use X = x\_1, x\_2,..., x\_P as the independent features for linear Regression, with xi as the independent feature and Y as the target variables. Let us say there are n samples of (X, y).

We consider the errors to have a normal distribution with mean 0 and constant variance sigma2, or (epsilon sim N(0, sigma2)). This presumption lets us model the target variable's distribution around the anticipated values.

### Probability Function

The probability distribution that provides the connection between the independent functions and the regression coefficients is known as the likelihood. It describes the likelihood of obtaining a particular set of results from a set of legitimate combinations of regression coefficients.

### Prior:

Priority is the parameter's original opinion or likelihood before viewing the data. It is knowledge of the parameters or an assumption about them.

We consider prior knowledge or assumptions regarding the parameters in the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate. We use a prior distribution, indicated by P(w|alpha) =N(0,alpha-1I), to express this previous knowledge.

### Posterior Distribution:

We can disregard it throughout the optimization process because it is independent of the parameter settings.

P(w | X,alpha,beta-1) is propto(L(Y|X,w,beta-1) cdot P(w|alpha)).

Traditional regression analysis and Bayesian probability theory are combined in the statistical modelling technique known as Bayesian Regression. Taking into account prior knowledge or assumptions regarding the model's defining characteristics. Bayesian Regression is especially helpful when working with sparse or noisy data or when you wish to make probabilistic claims about the model's parameters.

The main elements and ideas related to Bayesian Regression are listed below:

*   Prior Distribution: When using Bayesian Regression, the model parameters are initially distributed according to a prior. Before you observe any data, this represents your assumptions or knowledge of the parameters. If you have limited prior knowledge, the prior can be relatively uninformative or can be chosen depending on domain knowledge.
*   Likelihood Function: According to the model parameters, the likelihood function shows the likelihood of observing the data. It measures how closely the model matches the collected data.
*   Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): In the real world, it might be difficult computationally to establish the precise posterior distribution, especially for complicated models. MCMC techniques like Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings are frequently used to approximate the posterior distribution.
*   Bayesian Inference: You can use Bayesian inference once you obtain the posterior distribution. This entails calculating credible intervals (similar to confidence intervals in frequentist statistics), making predictions, and estimating the relevant parameters.
*   Model Comparison: By contrasting the posterior probability of several models, Bayesian Regression also enables model comparison. This might aid in selecting the best model for your data.

Overall, Bayesian Regression offers a framework for probabilistic modelling considering parameter uncertainty.

Types of Bayesian Regression:
-----------------------------

Typically, a normal distribution is used to depict the posterior distribution of the coefficients.

*   Bayesian Ridge Regression: In this type of ridge regression, the model parameters are subjected to L2 regularisation. It can be helpful when multicollinearity difficulties exist in the data and helps avoid overfitting.
*   Bayesian Lasso Regression: Bayesian Lasso adds L1 regularisation to the model parameters, much like ridge regression. This may result in sparse models that perform variable selection by having certain coefficients absolutely zero.
*   Bayesian Polynomial Regression: By including polynomial terms for the independent variables in the model, you may convert Bayesian Regression into Polynomial Regression. As a result, nonlinear connections between variables can be modelled.
*   Generalized Linear Models (GLM): Bayesian Regression can be modified to fit generalized linear models, which consider non-normal response variables and permit various link functions.

Advantages of Bayesian Regression:
----------------------------------

Integrating previous Information: One of the key benefits of Bayesian Regression is its capacity for integrating previous knowledge or assumptions on the model's parameters. This is very helpful when you have specialized information that can improve the model.

*   Regularisation: By automatically limiting the complexity of the model, Bayesian Regression helps prevent overfitting by providing regularisation.
*   Handles Small Data Sets: Because Bayesian approaches allow you to apply previous knowledge to enhance parameter estimates, they are very useful when working with small or sparse data sets.

Challenges and Considerations:
------------------------------

Complexity of the computations: For complicated models with large parameter spaces, computing the posterior distribution can be time-consuming. To solve this problem, MCMC methods are frequently employed.

*   Prior Distributions: The Bayesian regression results may be affected by the prior distributions that are chosen. Selecting proper priors that reflect your prior views or knowledge requires careful thought.
*   Interpretability: Although Bayesian Regression generates a wealth of probabilistic data, comprehending the findings can be more difficult than conventional regression techniques.
*   Model Comparison: Although Bayesian Regression makes it possible to compare several models, model selection can still be challenging, particularly when working with many potential predictors.

Conclusion:
-----------

In conclusion, Bayesian Regression is a potent statistical framework that produces probabilistic modelling and inference by fusing prior knowledge with observed data. It is useful when making predictions or estimating parameters and you wish to quantify uncertainty, consider prior information, and regularise models. However, it can be computationally taxing for complex models and requires careful selection.
