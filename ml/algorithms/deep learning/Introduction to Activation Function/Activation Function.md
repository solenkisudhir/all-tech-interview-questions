Activation functions in Neural Networks | Set2

The article Activation-functions-neural-networks will help to understand the use of activation function along with the explanation of some of its variants like linear, sigmoid, tanh, Relu and softmax. There are some other variants of the activation function like Elu, Selu, Leaky Relu, Softsign and Softplus which are discussed briefly in this articl

Activation functions in Neural Networks

It is recommended to understand Neural Networks before reading this article.  In the process of building a neural network, one of the choices you get to make is what Activation Function to use in the hidden layer as well as at the output layer of the network. This article discusses some of the choices. Elements of a Neural Network Input Layer: This

Mathematics | Unimodal functions and Bimodal functions

Unimodal Function : A function f(x) is said to be unimodal function if for some value m it is monotonically increasing for x&le;m and monotonically decreasing for x&ge;m. For function f(x), maximum value is f(m) and there is no other local maximum. See figure (A) and (B): In figure (A), graph has only one maximum point and rest of the graph goes do

Builtin functions of GCC compiler

These are four important built-in functions in GCC compiler: 1. \_\_builtin\_popcount(x) This function is used to count the number of one's(set bits) in an integer. Example: if x = 4 binary value of 4 is 100 Output: No of ones is 1. C/C++ Code // C program to illustrate \_builtin\_popcount(x) #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main() { int n = 5; printf(

std::legendre, std::legendref and std::legendrel functions in C++17

The legendre , legendref and legendrel are built functions in C++ STL that are used to compute the value of unassociated polynomials of degree n and argument x. Value of order-n unassociated Legendre Polynomial of x is given by : \[Tex\] \\\[ \\ P\_{n}(x)= \\frac{1}{2^{n}n!}\\frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}}(x^{2}-1)^{n} \\\] \[/Tex\] The first few Legendre polynomials are
