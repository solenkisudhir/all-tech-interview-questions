K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm across various aspects as requested:

### 1. Definition and Purpose

**What is the KNN algorithm and what is its main purpose?**
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Its main purpose is to classify a given data point based on how its neighbors are classified or to predict the value of a data point based on the values of its nearest neighbors.

**Can you explain the basic concept of the KNN algorithm and how it works?**
The KNN algorithm works by finding the 'K' closest data points (neighbors) to the point of interest. For classification tasks, it assigns the most common class among these neighbors to the new data point. For regression tasks, it predicts the value by averaging the values of the 'K' nearest neighbors. The distance between data points is typically calculated using distance metrics such as Euclidean distance.
