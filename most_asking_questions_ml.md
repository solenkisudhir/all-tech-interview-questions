### Fundamentals of Machine Learning

**1. What is machine learning?**
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

**2. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.**
- **Supervised learning:** In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where each training example is paired with a corresponding target variable (e.g., predicting house prices from features like size and location).
- **Unsupervised learning:** Unsupervised learning involves learning patterns from unlabeled data. The algorithm explores the data structure and identifies relationships without specific outputs to predict (e.g., clustering customer segments based on purchasing behavior).

**3. What are the main types of machine learning algorithms?**
- **Supervised learning algorithms:** Includes regression (predicting continuous values) and classification (predicting categorical labels).
- **Unsupervised learning algorithms:** Includes clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of variables).

**4. What is the bias-variance trade-off?**
The bias-variance trade-off refers to the challenge of simultaneously minimizing two sources of error in supervised learning models:
- **Bias:** Error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm (high bias can cause underfitting).
- **Variance:** Error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data (high variance can cause overfitting).

**5. What are the steps involved in a machine learning project?**
- **Problem definition:** Define the problem and goals.
- **Data collection:** Gather relevant data for training and evaluation.
- **Data preprocessing:** Clean, transform, and normalize data as necessary.
- **Feature engineering:** Select and extract relevant features from data.
- **Model selection:** Choose appropriate algorithms and architectures.
- **Training:** Train the model on training data.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance on test data using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model into production and monitor its performance.

### Algorithms and Techniques

**1. Explain how decision trees work.**
Decision trees recursively split the data based on features to create a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature and each leaf node represents a class label or value. It makes decisions by following paths from the root to the leaf based on feature thresholds.

**2. What is regularization, and why is it useful?**
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. It encourages the model to favor simpler hypotheses (with smaller coefficients or fewer parameters), reducing the risk of learning noise in the training data.

**3. Describe the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.**
KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It makes predictions by finding the most similar training examples (neighbors) in the feature space and averaging their labels (for regression) or voting (for classification).

**4. What is cross-validation, and why is it useful?**
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model. It involves splitting the data into multiple subsets (folds), training the model on some folds, and evaluating it on the remaining fold. This helps to estimate the model's performance and generalize well to unseen data.

**5. Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.**
- **L1 regularization (Lasso):** Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, encouraging sparsity (some coefficients become zero).
- **L2 regularization (Ridge):** Adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, leading to smaller but non-zero coefficients.

### Evaluation and Metrics

**1. What metrics would you use to evaluate a classification model?**
Common metrics include:
- Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among positive predictions.
- Recall (Sensitivity): Proportion of true positives correctly identified.
- F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.

**2. How would you handle imbalanced datasets in machine learning?**
Methods include:
- Resampling techniques (oversampling minority class, undersampling majority class).
- Using appropriate metrics like precision-recall curves.
- Adjusting class weights in the model to penalize misclassifications of the minority class.

**3. What is the confusion matrix, and how is it used?**
A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by displaying the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It helps to understand the model's errors and accuracy.

### Practical Considerations

**1. How do you handle missing or null values in a dataset?**
Options include:
- Imputation: Replace missing values with a calculated statistic (mean, median, mode).
- Deletion: Remove instances or features with missing values.
- Advanced techniques: Use models that handle missing data naturally (e.g., XGBoost).

**2. What are some feature selection techniques you have used?**
Techniques include:
- Filter methods: Select features based on statistical measures like correlation or mutual information.
- Wrapper methods: Evaluate subsets of features using the performance of a model.
- Embedded methods: Perform feature selection as part of the model training process (e.g., Lasso regression).

**3. Explain the bias-variance trade-off and how it affects model performance.**
The bias-variance trade-off refers to the trade-off between a model's ability to accurately capture the true relationship in data (bias) and its sensitivity to noise or variability (variance). Models with high bias may underfit the data, while models with high variance may overfit the data.

### Real-World Applications

**1. Describe a machine learning project you have worked on.**
Discuss a project where you defined the problem, gathered data, preprocessed it, selected a suitable model, trained and evaluated it, and possibly deployed it. Highlight challenges faced, solutions implemented, and outcomes achieved.

**2. How do you ensure the scalability of a machine learning model in production?**
Considerations include:
- Using efficient algorithms and frameworks.
- Optimizing model training and inference processes.
- Scaling infrastructure (e.g., using cloud services).
- Monitoring model performance and retraining as necessary.

These questions cover a broad range of topics in machine learning, from basic concepts and algorithms to practical implementation and real-world applications. Prepare well for these topics to demonstrate a solid understanding of machine learning principles and practices during interviews.
