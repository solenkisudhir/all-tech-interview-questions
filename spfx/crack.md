  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/spfx/command-set-extension-manifest.schema.json",
  "id": "ec2fda3b-60fc-4621-8b41-7b22a10a6bbd",
  "alias": "HelloWorldCommandSet",
  "componentType": "Extension",
  "extensionType": "ListViewCommandSet",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": 2,
  "requiresCustomScript": false,
  "items": {
    "COMMAND_1": {
      "title": {
        "default": "Hello World"
      },
      "iconImageUrl": "icons/helloworld.png",
      "type": "command"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Data Access:**

**Question:** How do you retrieve data from SharePoint lists or libraries in an SPFx solution?

**Answer:**

You can use the SharePoint Framework's `spHttpClient` to make REST API requests to SharePoint. Here's an example of fetching data from a SharePoint list:

```typescript
import { sp } from '@pnp/sp';

// Ensure that SharePoint library is initialized
sp.setup({
  spfxContext: this.context
});

// Fetch items from a SharePoint list
const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle('MyList').items.get();
console.log(items);
```

4. **Styling and Theming:**

**Question:** How do you apply custom styles to SPFx web parts and extensions?

**Answer:**

You can use CSS files or CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components to apply custom styles to SPFx components. Here's an example using styled-components:

```typescript
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: #0078d4;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #005a9e;
  }
`;

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return <StyledButton>Click Me</StyledButton>;
};
```

Sure, let's continue with more code examples for different questions:

5. **Deployment and Packaging:**

**Question:** How do you package an SPFx solution for deployment to SharePoint Online?

**Answer:**

To package an SPFx solution for deployment, you can use the `gulp bundle --ship` and `gulp package-solution --ship` commands. Here's an example:

```bash

gulp bundle --ship

# Package the solution for deployment
gulp package-solution --ship
```

This generates a `.sppkg` file in the `sharepoint/solution` folder, which can be uploaded to the App Catalog in SharePoint Online.

6. **Localization and Multilingual Support:**

**Question:** How do you implement localization in SPFx solutions to support multiple languages?

**Answer:**

SPFx provides built-in support for localization using resource (.resx) files. Here's an example of how to localize a web part:

```typescript
import * as strings from 'MyWebPartStrings';

// Access localized strings from resource files
console.log(strings.Title); // Output: "Welcome"
```

To add support for multiple languages, create resource files for each language and include them in the `loc` folder of your SPFx project.

7. **Testing Strategies:**

**Question:** What types of tests should you include in the testing strategy for an SPFx project?

**Answer:**

An effective testing strategy for an SPFx project typically includes:

- Integration tests to verify interactions between components.
- End-to-end tests to validate the functionality of the entire application.
- Snapshot tests to ensure UI consistency across different states.
- Performance tests to measure and optimize application performance.

Here's an example of a Jest unit test for an SPFx web part:

```typescript
import { MyWebPart } from '../components/MyWebPart';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';

describe('MyWebPart', () => {
  test('renders correctly', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyWebPart />);
    const element = getByText('Hello World');
    expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

Of course, let's continue with more code examples for additional questions:

8. **Code Quality and Maintainability:**

```

Following a consistent naming convention, indentation style, and commenting practices are essential for maintaining code quality across the project.

9. **Version Control and Collaboration:**

**Question:** How do you manage version control for SPFx projects using Git?

**Answer:**

Git is commonly used for version control in SPFx projects. Here's how you can manage version control:

```bash
# Initialize a Git repository in your SPFx project folder
git init

# Add all files to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Connect the local repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub)
git remote add origin <repository-url>

# Push changes to the remote repository
git push -u origin master
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize a Git repository, commit changes, and push them to a remote repository for collaboration.

10. **Migration and Upgrades:**

# Create an ESLint configuration file (e.g., .eslintrc.json)
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@microsoft/spfx/recommended"
  ]
}
```

By configuring ESLint with SharePoint-specific rules, developers can adhere to coding standards and ensure consistency across SPFx projects.

12. **Customization and Extensibility:**

**Question:** How do you customize SharePoint modern pages using SPFx extensions?

**Answer:**

SPFx extensions, such as Application Customizers, allow developers to customize SharePoint modern pages. Here's an example of adding a header to all modern pages:

```typescript
import { override } from '@microsoft/decorators';
import { BaseApplicationCustomizer } from '@microsoft/sp-application-base';
import { PlaceholderName } from '@microsoft/sp-application-base/lib/extensibility/ApplicationCustomizer';

export default class HeaderApplicationCustomizer extends BaseApplicationCustomizer {
  @override
  public onInit(): Promise<void> {
    // Add header to the top placeholder on modern pages
    this.context.placeholderProvider.placeholderNames.map((placeholderName) => {
      if (placeholderName === PlaceholderName.Top) {
        this.renderHeader();
      }
    });

    return Promise.resolve();
  }

  private renderHeader(): void {
    const headerElement: HTMLElement = document.createElement('div');
    headerElement.innerHTML = `
      <div class="header">
        <h1>Welcome to My SharePoint Site</h1>
      </div>
    `;
    const topPlaceholder: Element = document.querySelector('.ms-Header');
    if (topPlaceholder) {
      topPlaceholder.appendChild(headerElement);
    }
  }
}
```

By leveraging SPFx extensions like Application Customizers, developers can extend the functionality of SharePoint modern pages to meet specific customization requirements.

steps:
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '12.x'
    displayName: 'Install Node.js'

  - script: |
      npm install
      npm run build -- --ship
      gulp bundle --ship
      gulp package-solution --ship
    displayName: 'Build and package SPFx solution'

  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    inputs:
      pathtoPublish: 'sharepoint/solution'
      artifactName: 'drop'
    displayName: 'Publish artifact'
```

This pipeline triggers on commits to the `main` branch, installs dependencies, builds and packages the SPFx solution, and publishes the artifact for deployment.

15. **Security and Compliance:**

**Question:** What measures can you take to secure sensitive data such as API keys or connection strings in SPFx projects?

**Answer:**

To secure sensitive data in SPFx projects, you can use environment variables, Azure Key Vault, or encrypted secrets in CI/CD pipelines. Here's an example of using environment variables:

```typescript

```bash
yo @microsoft/sharepoint
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project, including the solution name, web part name, description, and framework of choice (e.g., React, Angular, or no JavaScript framework).

**Web Part Lifecycle in SPFx:**

The lifecycle of a web part in SPFx consists of several phases:

1. **Initialization:** The web part is initialized, and its properties are set.
2. **Render:** The web part's UI is rendered on the page.
3. **Data Loading:** Data is fetched from external sources or SharePoint lists.
4. **Update:** The web part may re-render based on changes to its properties or state.
5. **Dispose:** The web part is removed from the page, and any resources are cleaned up.

**Example of Creating a Simple Web Part:**

Let's create a basic web part that displays a greeting message. We'll use the React framework for this example.

1. Run the Yeoman generator to create a new web part project:

```bash
yo @microsoft/sharepoint
```

Follow the prompts and select React as the framework.

2. Open the generated project in your code editor.

3. Navigate to the `src\webparts` directory and locate the folder for your newly created web part (e.g., `helloWorld`).

4. Open the `HelloWorldWebPart.ts` file and update the `render()` method to display a greeting message:

```typescript
public render(): void {
  const element: React.ReactElement<IHelloWorldProps> = React.createElement(
    HelloWorld,
    {
      description: this.properties.description,
      context: this.context.pageContext.web.title,
    }
  );

  ReactDom.render(element, this.domElement);
}
```

5. Create a new React component file named `HelloWorld.tsx` in the same directory with the following content:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import styles from './HelloWorld.module.scss';
import { IHelloWorldProps } from './IHelloWorldProps';
import { escape } from '@microsoft/sp-lodash-subset';

export const HelloWorld: React.FunctionComponent<IHelloWorldProps> = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.helloWorld}>
      <div className={styles.container}>
        <div className={styles.row}>
          <div className={styles.column}>
            <span className={styles.title}>{props.description}</span>
            <p className={styles.subTitle}>Welcome to {props.context}!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

6. Build and package the solution:

```bash
gulp build
gulp bundle --ship
gulp package-solution --ship
```

Certainly! Let's provide code samples for some of the topics we discussed:

### Web Parts:
**Creating a new web part using the Yeoman generator:**
```bash
yo @microsoft/sharepoint:webpart
```
This command will generate the necessary files for a new web part, including TypeScript files, manifest files, and configuration files.

**Example of a simple SPFx web part rendering dynamic content:**
```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { WebPartContext } from '@microsoft/sp-webpart-base';

export interface IMyWebPartProps {
  context: WebPartContext;
}

export interface IMyWebPartState {
  items: any[];
}

export default class MyWebPart extends React.Component<IMyWebPartProps, IMyWebPartState> {
  constructor(props: IMyWebPartProps) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      items: []
    };
  }

  public componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch data from SharePoint list
    this.loadData();
  }

  private async loadData() {
    const response = await this.props.context.spHttpClient.get(`${this.props.context.pageContext.web.absoluteUrl}/_api/lists/getbytitle('MyList')/items`, {
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json;odata=nometadata'
      }
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({ items: data.value });
  }

  public render(): React.ReactElement<IMyWebPartProps> {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Web Part</h1>
        <ul>
          {this.state.items.map(item => (
            <li key={item.Id}>{item.Title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
This web part fetches data from a SharePoint list and renders it dynamically.

### Extensions:
**Example of an application customizer to customize the header:**
```typescript
import { override } from '@microsoft/decorators';
import { BaseApplicationCustomizer } from '@microsoft/sp-application-base';
import { Dialog } from '@microsoft/sp-dialog';
import { sp } from '@pnp/sp';

export interface IHeaderCustomizerProperties {
  welcomeMessage: string;
}

export default class HeaderCustomizer extends BaseApplicationCustomizer<IHeaderCustomizerProperties> {

  @override
  public onInit(): Promise<void> {
    sp.setup({
      spfxContext: this.context
    });
    this.renderHeader();
    return Promise.resolve();
  }

  private async renderHeader() {
    const headerElement: HTMLElement = document.getElementsByClassName('ms-Header')[0] as HTMLElement;
    if (headerElement) {
      const welcomeMessage = this.properties.welcomeMessage || 'Welcome!';
      headerElement.innerHTML += `<div>${welcomeMessage}</div>`;
    }
  }
}
```
This application customizer adds a welcome message to the SharePoint header.

### Data Access:
**Fetching data from a SharePoint list using PnPjs:**
```typescript
import { sp } from '@pnp/sp';

async function fetchData() {
  const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle('MyList').items.select('Title', 'Description').getAll();
  return items;
}
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to use PnPjs to fetch data from a SharePoint list.

### Styling and Theming:
**Applying custom styles to an SPFx web part:**
```css
.myWebPart {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
This CSS defines custom styles for an SPFx web part.

**Dynamically applying theme colors to components:**
```typescript
import { ThemeProvider, ThemeChangedEventArgs, ThemeChangedEventArgs } from '@microsoft/sp-component-base';

export default class MyThemedComponent extends React.Component<any, any> {

  private themeProvider: ThemeProvider;
  private _themeVariant: IReadonlyTheme | undefined;

  constructor(props: any) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      themeVariant: undefined
    };
  }

  public componentDidMount() {
    this.themeProvider = this.props.context.serviceScope.consume(ThemeProvider.serviceKey);
    this.themeProvider.themeChangedEvent.add(this, this._handleThemeChanged);
    this._themeVariant = this.themeProvider.tryGetTheme();
    this.setState({
      themeVariant: this._themeVariant
    });
  }

  private _handleThemeChanged(args: ThemeChangedEventArgs): void {
    this._themeVariant = args.theme;
    this.setState({
      themeVariant: this._themeVariant
    });
  }

  public render(): React.ReactElement<any> {
    const theme = this.state.themeVariant;
    const themeColor = theme.semanticColors.bodyBackground;
    return (
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: themeColor }}>
        Themed Component
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
This React component dynamically applies the current theme's background color to its background.

### Deployment Strategies:
**Packaging an SPFx solution for deployment to SharePoint Online:**
To package an SPFx solution for deployment to SharePoint Online, you run the following command in your project directory:
```bash
gulp bundle --ship && gulp package-solution --ship
```
This command bundles your solution's assets for production and packages them into a .sppkg file ready for deployment.

**Automating the deployment of SPFx solutions using CI/CD pipelines:**
You can automate the deployment of SPFx solutions using continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Here's an example Azure Pipelines YAML configuration:
```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: |
    npm install -g gulp yo
    npm install
    gulp bundle --ship
    gulp package-solution --ship
  displayName: 'Build SPFx Solution'

- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/sharepoint/solution/*.sppkg'
    artifactName: 'SPFxPackage'
  displayName: 'Publish SPFx Package'
```
This pipeline installs Node.js, builds the SPFx solution, and publishes the .sppkg package as a pipeline artifact.

### Localization and Multilingual Support:
**Implementing localization in SPFx solutions to support multiple languages:**
You can implement localization in SPFx solutions using resource files (.resx) for each supported language. Here's an example of how to define resources for English (en-us) and French (fr-fr):
```
MyStrings.en-us.resx:
- HelloWorld: "Hello World!"

MyStrings.fr-fr.resx:
- HelloWorld: "Bonjour le monde!"
```
You then reference these resources in your code based on the current user's language preference.

**Dynamically switching languages in an SPFx application based on user preferences:**
You can dynamically switch languages in an SPFx application by detecting the user's language preference and loading the appropriate resource file. Here's an example of how to dynamically load resources based on the current language:
```typescript
import { Environment, EnvironmentType } from '@microsoft/sp-core-library';

let currentLocale: string;

if (Environment.type === EnvironmentType.SharePoint || Environment.type === EnvironmentType.ClassicSharePoint) {
  // Retrieve current user's language preference from SharePoint context
  currentLocale = this.context.pageContext.cultureInfo.currentCultureName;
} else {
  // Default to English if running in local workbench
  currentLocale = 'en-us';
}

const strings: IMyStrings = require(`./loc/${currentLocale}.js`);
```
This code snippet loads the appropriate resource file based on the current locale.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment:
**Setting up continuous integration (CI) for SPFx projects:**
You can set up continuous integration for SPFx projects using CI/CD platforms like Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions. Here's a basic example of an Azure Pipelines YAML configuration for CI:
```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: |
    npm install -g gulp yo
    npm install
    gulp build
  displayName: 'Build SPFx Solution'
```
This pipeline triggers on changes to the main branch, installs Node.js, and builds the SPFx solution.

**Configuring CI pipelines to build, test, and package SPFx solutions automatically:**
In addition to building the solution, you can configure CI pipelines to run automated tests and package the solution. Here's an enhanced Azure Pipelines YAML configuration:
```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: |
    npm install -g gulp yo
    npm install
    gulp test
    gulp bundle --ship
    gulp package-solution --ship
  displayName: 'Build, Test, and Package SPFx Solution'
```
This pipeline installs dependencies, runs tests, bundles the solution, and packages it for deployment.

**Deploying SPFx solutions to development, staging, and production environments using CI/CD pipelines:**
You can extend your CI/CD pipelines to deploy SPFx solutions to different environments based on triggers or manual approval gates. Here's an example of deploying to multiple environments using Azure Pipelines:
```yaml
- stage: DeployDevelopment
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployDev
    displayName: 'Deploy to Development'
    environment: 'Development'
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - download: current
            artifact: SPFxPackage
          - task: SharePointAppCatalog@1
            inputs:
              action: 'Upload'
              appCatalogUrl: '$(appCatalogUrl)'
              files: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/sharepoint/solution/*.sppkg'

- stage: DeployStaging
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployStaging
    displayName: 'Deploy to Staging'
    environment: 'Staging'
    dependsOn: DeployDevelopment
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - download: current
            artifact: SPFxPackage
          - task: SharePointAppCatalog@1
            inputs:
              action: 'Upload'
              appCatalogUrl: '$(appCatalogUrl)'
              files: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/sharepoint/solution/*.sppkg'
```
This YAML configuration defines stages for deploying to development and staging environments sequentially.

**Tenant-scoped deployment in SharePoint Framework:**
```plaintext
- Tenant-scoped deployment allows deploying SPFx solutions at the tenant level, making them available to all site collections within the SharePoint Online tenant.
- This deployment model provides centralized management, governance, and administration of SPFx solutions across the entire SharePoint environment.
- Tenant-scoped deployment is suitable for solutions that provide enterprise-wide functionality, reusable components, or governance controls that need to be uniformly applied across the organization.
- Administrators can deploy and manage tenant-scoped SPFx solutions using the SharePoint Online administration portal or PowerShell commands.
```

**Measures to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements in SPFx solutions:**
```plaintext
1. Data encryption: Encrypt sensitive data stored or transmitted by SPFx solutions using encryption algorithms and protocols compliant with industry standards (e.g., AES, TLS).
2. Data access controls: Implement access controls, permissions, and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data and resources within SPFx solutions based on user roles and privileges.
3. Data retention policies: Define data retention policies and lifecycle management rules to govern the storage, archiving, and deletion of data processed or managed by SPFx solutions in compliance with regulatory requirements.
4. Audit logging: Enable audit logging and monitoring capabilities within SPFx solutions to track and log user activities, data access events, and security-related incidents for compliance reporting and forensic analysis.
5. Compliance certifications: Obtain and maintain compliance certifications (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001) for SPFx solutions by adhering to industry standards, best practices, and regulatory requirements applicable to the organization's jurisdiction and business operations.
```

**Implementing versioning and rollback procedures in SPFx development:**
```plaintext
1. Version control: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes, revisions, and releases of SPFx solutions, enabling versioning, rollback, and historical reference of codebase snapshots.
2. Release management: Adopt release management practices and procedures to manage the deployment, promotion, and rollback of SPFx solutions across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) in a controlled and coordinated manner.
3. Rollback strategy: Define rollback strategies and contingency plans to revert to previous versions of SPFx solutions in case of deployment failures, critical errors, or adverse impacts on system performance or user experience.
4. Automated deployments: Implement automated deployment pipelines and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to automate the deployment process, minimize human errors, and ensure consistency and repeatability in deployment workflows.
5. Testing and validation: Conduct thorough testing, validation, and acceptance criteria verification before deploying new versions of SPFx solutions to production environments to mitigate risks and ensure the stability and reliability of the deployed solutions.

### Customization and Extensibility:

**Customizing SharePoint modern pages using SPFx extensions:**
```plaintext
- SPFx extensions allow developers to extend the functionality and user experience of SharePoint modern pages by injecting custom scripts, styles, or components into the page.
- Application customizers: Application customizers enable developers to add custom header or footer elements, navigation menus, or notifications to SharePoint modern pages, providing contextual enhancements and branding.
- Field customizers: Field customizers allow developers to customize the rendering and behavior of specific fields or columns within SharePoint lists or libraries, such as rendering custom UI controls or formatting data.
- Command sets: Command sets enable developers to add custom commands, actions, or buttons to the SharePoint user interface (e.g., list view, list item context menu), enabling user interactions and workflow automation.
- ListView Command Sets: Custom List View Command Sets allow developers to add buttons or menu items to the command bar of SharePoint list views, providing users with quick actions or shortcuts for common tasks.
- Site Customizers: Site Customizers allow developers to apply custom branding, layout, and user interface elements to SharePoint sites, such as custom navigation, page layouts, or theme integrations.
```

**Difference between application customizers and field customizers in SPFx:**
```plaintext
- Application customizers: Application customizers extend the SharePoint user interface at the page level by injecting custom scripts or components into the header or footer of modern pages. They allow developers to add custom branding, navigation menus, notifications, or contextual enhancements that apply to the entire page or site.
- Field customizers: Field customizers extend the SharePoint user interface at the field level by customizing the rendering and behavior of specific fields or columns within SharePoint lists or libraries. They allow developers to override the default rendering of field values, apply custom formatting, or inject additional UI controls or interactions for enhanced data presentation or user experience.
```

**Extending the SharePoint user interface with custom commands or actions using SPFx:**
```plaintext
- Command sets: Command sets in SPFx allow developers to extend the SharePoint user interface by adding custom commands, actions, or buttons to the command bar or context menu of SharePoint list views or list items. Developers can define custom actions (e.g., execute custom logic, trigger workflows) and associate them with specific events or conditions (e.g., selection of list items, click events).
- ListView Command Sets: ListView Command Sets are a specific type of command set designed for customizing the command bar of SharePoint list views. Developers can define custom buttons or menu items with associated actions (e.g., navigate to a URL, execute JavaScript function) to provide users with quick access to common tasks or workflow actions directly from the list view interface.
```

**Creating and deploying custom list view Command Sets in SPFx:**
```plaintext
1. Scaffold Command Set project: Use the SharePoint Framework Yeoman generator to scaffold a new Command Set project, specifying the project name, extension type (e.g., ListView Command Set), and target SharePoint environment.
2. Implement command set logic: Implement the logic for custom commands, actions, or buttons within the Command Set TypeScript file, defining command properties (e.g., title, icon, action) and associated event handlers (e.g., onClick).
3. Test and debug: Test the Command Set functionality in a local development environment, using tools like the SharePoint Workbench or a SharePoint Online test site to validate the behavior and interaction of custom commands with SharePoint lists and libraries.
4. Package and deploy: Package the Command Set project into a SharePoint solution package (.sppkg) using the gulp bundle and gulp package-solution commands, then deploy the solution package to the target SharePoint environment using the SharePoint app catalog or PowerShell.
5. Add to list view: Once deployed, activate the Command Set feature on the target SharePoint site or list, then customize the list view to include the custom commands by configuring the Command Set settings and associating it with the desired list or library.
```

**Options for customizing the SharePoint site layout and branding with SPFx:**
```plaintext
1. Application customizers: Use application customizers in SPFx to inject custom scripts, styles, or components into the header, footer, or other sections of SharePoint modern pages to apply custom branding, navigation menus, or global enhancements.
2. Site theming: Leverage SharePoint site theming capabilities to apply custom color schemes, fonts, and logos to SharePoint sites using the out-of-the-box theming engine or custom theme files, providing consistent branding across the site.
3. Site designs and site scripts: Define site designs and site scripts in SharePoint to automate site provisioning tasks and apply custom configurations, branding elements, or pre-defined structures to newly created sites using SPFx extensions and scripts.
4. Modern page layouts: Create custom modern page layouts using SPFx extensions or SharePoint Framework web parts to design and implement custom page templates with specific content structures, layouts, or branding elements tailored to organizational requirements.
